# Repository Guidelines

At initialization, read these resources to understand how this knowledge base is organized and maintained:

1. `README.md` – overview of repository purpose and directory structure.
2. `TEMPLATE.md` – required front matter and section layout for every note.
3. `TO_LEARN.md` – backlog workflow for future topics and indexing steps.
4. `knowledge_base.py` – CLI for adding and searching vector-indexed documents.
5. Sample concept notes such as `concepts/distributed-systems/sharded-services.md` and `concepts/distributed-systems/event-sourcing.md` – concrete examples of the expected writing style and metadata.
