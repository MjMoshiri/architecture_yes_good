## Summary

Sharding is a database architecture pattern used to horizontally partition data into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is a separate database instance that holds a subset of the total data. This pattern is used to improve scalability and performance by distributing the data and load across multiple servers.

## Core Concepts

-   **Shard Key:** A specific column or field in the data that is used to determine which shard the data belongs to. The choice of a good shard key is crucial for even data distribution.
-   **Routing:** A mechanism is needed to route queries to the correct shard based on the shard key. This can be handled by the application, a dedicated routing service, or the database itself.
-   **Rebalancing:** As data grows or the number of shards changes, data may need to be moved between shards to maintain a balanced distribution.

## Use Cases

-   **Good for:** Large-scale applications with massive datasets that cannot be handled by a single database server. Applications that require high write throughput.
-   **Not for:** Smaller applications where the complexity of sharding is not justified. Applications where most queries need to access data from multiple shards, as this can be inefficient.
