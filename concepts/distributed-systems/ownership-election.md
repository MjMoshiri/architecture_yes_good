## Summary

In a distributed system, it's often necessary to have a single instance responsible for a particular task or resource. This is known as ownership or leadership. Ownership election (or leader election) is the process by which a single process is chosen from a group of processes to be the leader. This pattern is crucial for coordination and ensuring that certain operations are performed by only one member of a group at a time.

## Core Concepts

-   **Leader:** The single process elected to perform a specific task.
-   **Followers:** The other processes in the group that are not the leader.
-   **Election:** The mechanism by which a leader is chosen. This can be triggered on startup or when the current leader fails.
-   **Health Checks:** Mechanisms for followers to detect if the leader has failed, so a new election can be triggered.

## Use Cases

-   **Good for:** Systems that require a single point of coordination, such as a master database in a primary-replica setup, or a component responsible for assigning tasks to workers.
-   **Not for:** Systems where all instances are equal and there is no need for a single coordinator.
