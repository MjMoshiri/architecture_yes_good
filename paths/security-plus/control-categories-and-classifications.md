## Summary

Quick reference for the classic Security+ control categories (technical, managerial, operational, physical) and the functional classifications (preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, directive, compensating).

## Core Concepts

-   **Control Categories:** Group controls by how they are applied—tech, people, and facilities.
-   **Functional Classifications:** Describe what the control does—stop, find, fix, scare, guide, or substitute.

## Control Categories

-   **Technical:** Tech-driven safeguards such as firewalls, MFA, encryption, endpoint agents.
-   **Managerial:** Administrative tools like policies, risk assessments, and security training plans.
-   **Operational:** Day-to-day procedures including change control, incident response drills, backup routines.
-   **Physical:** Facility protections like locks, guards, cameras, lighting, and mantraps.

## Functional Classifications

-   **Preventive:** Block issues before they start (least privilege, network segmentation, hardening).
-   **Detective:** Discover problems after they occur (IDS alerts, log reviews, CCTV monitoring).
-   **Corrective:** Restore normal operations (backups, patches, reimaging, recovery scripts).
-   **Deterrent:** Make attackers think twice (warning banners, visible guards, prosecution policies).

# Other Classifications
-   **Directive:** Tell people the required actions (SOPs, configuration baselines, mandatory training).
-   **Compensating:** Alternate control that plugs the gap when a primary control is missing.
